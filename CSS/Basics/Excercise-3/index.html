                <p>
                    You just don’t understand economics, like supply and demand. Don’t worry kiddo, where there’s a demand

                    you consider that theft?

                    Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons.<br><br>
                    A world where voluntarism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
